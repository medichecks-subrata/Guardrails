"""Tool-result validation rail for IORails.

Structurally validates the tool results carried on an incoming request against
the tool calls the model previously made: every result must link to a prior
call by ``call_id``, name a tool consistent with that call, and carry
well-formed content. This PR validates structure only -- there are no declared
response schemas yet. The rail is local and model-free; it runs through
:meth:`ToolRailAction._guarded`, so a malformed result or an unexpected error
fails closed (blocks) rather than propagating.
