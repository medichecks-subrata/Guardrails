"""Concurrency & contextvar isolation under ``asyncio.gather`` (RECORDED_TEST_PLAN §5.1).

Cassette replay serializes requests, so it cannot prove that concurrent
``generate_async`` calls do not cross-talk through the per-request contextvars
(``llm_stats_var``, ``generation_options_var``, ``explain_info_var``,
``streaming_handler_var``, ``raw_llm_request``). The decomposition centralizes all of
those in ``generation/generation_context.py``; if any were a mis-scoped global instead
of a properly copied contextvar, concurrent tasks would bleed completions / activated
rails / stats into each other.

``asyncio.gather`` runs each coroutine in its own copied context, so the correct
behavior is that concurrency changes nothing: the per-request result is identical to
running the same request alone. These tests assert exactly that. They are the
parallel-task complement to A6.2 (which covers the sequential, single-task slice), are
fully deterministic (``FakeLLMModel``, no cassette), and pass identically on both
pre-refactor and the decomposed refactor.

Assertions stay on the stable ``log.llm_calls`` invariant (not ``explain()``, whose
accumulate-vs-reset semantics differ across the two code paths — see A6.2).
