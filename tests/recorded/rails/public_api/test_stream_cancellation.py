"""Streaming cancellation / teardown / partial-on-abort (RECORDED_TEST_PLAN §5.4, A3.13).

Cassette replay returns the whole recorded body in one shot, so it can never reproduce
a consumer that stops early or a cancelled task. ``stream_async`` returns the external
``generator`` directly when there are no streaming output rails, and wraps it via
``_run_output_rails_in_streaming`` otherwise; both paths must tear the source generator
down cleanly when the consumer aborts, delivering only the chunks produced before the
abort point (no buffered tail).

These tests drive a *tracking* async generator that yields a known prefix and then
blocks forever, so the consumer is the only thing that can end the stream. The
generator records (via a ``finally``) whether it was closed, which is the observable
proof that ``aclose()`` / cancellation propagated to the source. Fully deterministic
(no cassette), and identical behavior is expected on both pre-refactor and the
decomposed refactor.

    generator (``run_output_rails_in_streaming``), that propagation is lost: closing the
    wrapper does not close the wrapped source, so a real source holding a network
    connection would leak until garbage collection. This behavior is **identical on
