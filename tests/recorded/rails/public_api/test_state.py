"""State threading and explain/log isolation for the public ``generate_async`` API.

Both scenarios exercise logic the decomposition moved (``colang_turns``,
``serialization``, ``generation_context``) and are fully deterministic, so they use
``FakeLLMModel`` for the main generation and need no cassette: the state round-trip
and the per-call log isolation do not depend on a real provider response.

    ``GenerationResponse.log.llm_calls`` contains only that call's LLM calls, never the
    previous call's. This is the substantive no-leak guarantee, and it is what is
    asserted here.

    Behavior change surfaced (flagged, deliberately NOT pinned as an invariant): the
    running ``rails.explain().llm_calls`` tally differs between the two code paths. Pre-
    decomposition it *accumulates* across sequential calls in the same async context
    (``["first reply", "second reply"]``); post-decomposition ``generation_context``
    resets it per call (``["second reply"]``). Both are consistent with the no-leak
    guarantee on ``log.llm_calls``; only the ``explain()`` tally changed (an apparent
    improvement worth confirming as intended). Because that count cannot hold on both
    sides, we assert only that ``explain()``'s most recent entry is the current call.
