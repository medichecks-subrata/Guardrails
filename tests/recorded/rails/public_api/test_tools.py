"""Tool calling surfaced through the public ``generate_async`` API (B5.1).

The tools schema is supplied per-call via ``options.llm_params`` (which are spread as
kwargs onto the provider request); ``tool_choice`` forces the call so the recorded
response is deterministic. The provider's tool call is surfaced on
``GenerationResponse.tool_calls`` by the generation_response assembly.
